Weekly stand up meeting

	In this weeks stand up meeting we discussed what our roles in the project thus far have been, 
  what tasks we are currently working on, and upcoming tasks that need to be completed. In this most 
  recent project milestone our roles in the team have become more well defined as specific tasks need 
  to be done in order to get the app working properly. Also members of both the frontend and backend 
  team have been working on all aspects of the project depending on where they are needed. Currently 
  we are working on connecting all of the pieces of the project in order to get a working finished 
  product for the upcoming demo. One of the largest challenges we currently face is dynamically 
  updating reads which members of both the fronted and backend team are working to solve. As we 
  look toward to the upcoming deadlines we still need to create and present a working demo, fix 
  minor bugs to make the app run more smoothly, create a final project presentation, and work 
  on reach goals if we have time.
