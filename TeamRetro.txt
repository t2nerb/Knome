Team Retrospective

Good:
	-Strong communication through Slack and Github projects
	-Pair programming has been very useful in completing tasks efficently 
	-Support from both frontend and backend teams on all aspects of the project
	-Milestones have been completed with quality work on time
	-We have a working product that meet our expectations 
Bad:
	-Roles were not well defined leaving some ambiguity in task allocation 
	-Firebase steep learning curve and debugging difficulties made some tasks take longer than expected
	-In person meetings increased our productivity so more of those would accelerate the project
	-Differences in coding styles made bringing the idividual pieces of the project together more difficult
	-A smaller team would be more efficent 
Plan Going Forward:
	-Meet in person more frequently to finish the project
	-Discuss reach goals and the requirements and intrest in meeting them
	-Correct minor bugs in the project
	-Prepare a final presentation the showcases our product
