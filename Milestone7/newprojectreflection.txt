Successful:
  Slack:
    Was very successful because we could quickly come up with ideas and talk about the issues we were having.
  GitHub:
    Useful to see what other's had recently done, and to have a consistent idea of where we were at
  GitHub Pages:
    Perfect for hosting platform. Every commit to 'master' was immediately visible from any device
    Made mobile viewing possible
  Bootstrap:
    Perfect for quick styles and mobile responsiveness
  Firebase:
    Allowed user authentication and database to share a platform
    Allowed easy database writes/reads via frontend
  Google Maps API:
    Although not the only mapping api we considered, Google's was ideal because of extensive documentation
  
  
  
Unsuccessful:
  AngularJS:
    We decided it was not necessary to constrain ourselves to a specific JS framework, vanilla JS was fine
  Flask:
    Although flask would've been ideal for scaling to new platforms and building out more features, it proved too steep a learning curve to expect our whole team to learn.
  MySQL:
    An obvious first choice, we ditched when we decided to use Firebase which offered realtime updates to our map
  Trello:
    Obviously a great product, but it made more sense to go with Github's projects because that was our homebase for our code and hosting
