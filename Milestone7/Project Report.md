## Status
We have a working website at https://t2nerb.github.io/Knome/, with login/logout and the ability to add 
events to the map. In addition, the map displays all the events in the user's scope, and updates in 
real time with any added events.

## Accomplishments:
- A simple and clean website
- User login/logout and account creation
- Event viewing through a map
- Event creation though an icon on the map
- Variable scope of how many events are shown through map scrolling

## Outstanding Problems:
- Events exist forever after creation
- There is no 'voting' system for showing if an event is real/good
- There is no forgot password system

## Plan to fix Outstanding Problems:
Currently, we plan to continue work much as we have for this semster. Coordinating through Slack and 
Github Projects/Issues, we will track bugs and issues and fix them as they arise.
